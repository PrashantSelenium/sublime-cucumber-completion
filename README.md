Supported Step Definition Formats
---------------------------------

Step definitions can be defined in many languages as the cucumber gherkin
language is parsable in various programming languages.

Autocompletion has been tested and works for the examples found in:
* https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber with the exception of the following:
    * i18n - languages other than the English are not supported yet
    * python - steps defined in python are not suppoerted yet
    * v8 - steps defined in javascript are not supported yet
* groovy examples in https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm
Support for steps defined in different language types is planned including
python, javascript as well as Java and other JVM based languages.

Supported formats in different languages will be explicitely defined via
tests in the future.
